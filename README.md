## mobile (React Native / Expo)

A new Expo-managed React Native app has been created in the `mobile/` directory.

Quick start (from the repository root):

- Change into the mobile app folder:

	cd mobile

- Start the development server:

	npm start

- Run on Android (requires Android emulator or device):

	npm run android

- Run on iOS (requires macOS to build natively) or use the Expo Go app for iOS development without a Mac:

	npm run ios

- Run in web browser:

	npm run web

Notes:

- This project was initialized with an Expo-managed workflow for easier cross-platform development on Windows.
- If you don't have Node.js or npm installed, install them first. If `npx create-expo-app` failed, ensure you have a recent Node.js LTS version and retry.
